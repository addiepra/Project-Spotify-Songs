# Popular Spotify Songs

## Introduction:

The "Popular Spotify Songs" project aims to analyze and understand the landscape of popular music across various platforms, focusing primarily on Spotify. The dataset provides a comprehensive list of the most famous songs and their streaming statistics, along with attributes such as track name, artist's name, release date, presence on other music platforms like Apple Music and Deezer, and various audio features.

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to gain insights into the factors contributing to the popularity of songs on Spotify and other music platforms. By analyzing streaming statistics, presence on different platforms, and audio features, we aim to identify patterns and trends in popular music. Additionally, we seek to understand how songs perform across different platforms and whether there are any correlations between streaming statistics and other attributes.

## Project Phases:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather the dataset containing information about popular Spotify songs and their attributes such as track name, artist's name, release date, streaming statistics, and presence on other music platforms.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types if necessary. This phase also involves encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations between attributes, and visualize trends in popular music. This phase may involve plotting histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of the dataset. This may include extracting information from text fields, aggregating data, or deriving new variables based on domain knowledge.

5. **Model Building:** Develop predictive models to analyze the factors influencing the popularity of songs on Spotify and other platforms. This may involve techniques such as regression analysis, classification, or clustering to predict streaming statistics or identify patterns in the data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Fine-tune the models if necessary to improve their predictive accuracy.

7. **Insights and Conclusion:** Summarize the findings from the analysis, including key insights into the factors driving the popularity of songs on Spotify and other platforms. Draw conclusions about the relationship between streaming statistics, audio features, and other attributes. Additionally, discuss potential implications and recommendations for stakeholders in the music industry.
